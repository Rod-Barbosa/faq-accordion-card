## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS script tag

### What I learned

The script tag should go at the end of the file.
```html
    <script src="myscripts.js"></script>

</body>
```

### Continued development

Eventually I need to get the handle of the position: absolute. Chances are, hihg paying clients won't care for something cool, thay will jsut want the design to behave the way it does in their heads.

### Useful resources

- [Accordeon FAQ](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) This one basically gives you the bones for the project

## Acknowledgments

I found this app for resizing the browser in http://serdar.work/
Suuuper helpfull
it ended up not being a short cut (it promises to make ctrl+shift+a do the trick) but the button to choose size is improvement enough
